This is the source code for the new version of my 25K/month visitors blog. **100% not vibe coded.**

**You can do whatever you want with the code. (Blog posts are mine, though!)**

## Roadmap

### Left to do

- [ ] **Livewire-based comments system**
  - [x] Listing comments
  - [ ] Adding comments
  - [ ] Deleting comments
  - [ ] Editing comments
  - [ ] Replying to other comments

### Done

- [x] **Community links**: People can send content they created.
- [ ] **Email notifications**
  - [ ] To the admin for new comments
  - [ ] To users for replies to comments
- [ ] **Custom theme for emails**
- [x] **SEO optimizations**: This is only 10% of the work as you still have to write good content people search for on Google.
- [x] **Filament admin panel**
- [x] **Affiliate links management**: This is how I make money from this blog.
- [x] **Automatic table of contents**
- [x] **User accounts tied to GitHub**
- [x] **Incredible speed thanks to `wire:navigate` from Livewire v3**
- [x] **Visits tracking on the backend to bypass adblockers thanks to [Pirsch's API](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/pirsch-analytics)**
