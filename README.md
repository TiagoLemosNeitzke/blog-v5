This is the source code for the new version of thousands of visitors blog. **100% not vibe coded.**

**You can do whatever you want with the code.**

## Roadmap

### Left to do

- **Livewire-based comments system**
  - Listing comments
  - Adding comments
  - Deleting comments
  - Editing comments
  - Replying to other comments
- **Email notifications**
  - To the admin for new comments
  - To users for replies to comments
  - To the admin when a new link is submitted
  - To users when one of their links is approved

### Done

- **Community links**: People can send content they created.
- **SEO optimizations**: This is only 10% of the work as you still have to write good content people search for on Google.
- **Filament admin panel**
- **Custom theme for emails**
- **Affiliate links management**: This is how I make money from this blog.
- **Automatic table of contents**
- **User accounts tied to GitHub**
- **Incredible speed thanks to `wire:navigate` from Livewire v3**
- **Visits tracking on the backend to bypass adblockers thanks to [Pirsch's API](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/pirsch-analytics)**
