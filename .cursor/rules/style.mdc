- Take inspiration from the codebase.
- Don't create a variable if it's used only once.
- Comments start with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Run `php vendor/bin/pint --parallel` to format the code whenever you make a change.
- In tests, fake OpenAI calls using OpenAI::fake() with Responses CreateResponse::fake(), not facade mocking.
- When you write tests, run and fix them until they pass. (Use the --parallel option to speed up the process.)
